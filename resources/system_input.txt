I will provide you with a text. Follow the instructions below carefully.

If it is not in english, respond with "(not in english)", followed by translated english text.
If it has spelling mistakes, respond with "(spelling mistakes)", followed by corrected text.
If it has no issues, respond with "(no issues)", followed by the text.


After checking for all the above scenarios, do 2 things. 
1. return key concepts and weights to show relevance of each concept (on a scale of 1-10, 10 being the most relevant and 1 being irrelevant)
2. try not to return key concepts that are too similar
3. make sure that all text returned is in lowercase and in valid JSON in English.
